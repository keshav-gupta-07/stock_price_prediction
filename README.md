# stock_price_prediction

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting.

Requirements - 
1) Python 3.x
2) TensorFlow
3) Pandas
4) NumPy
5) Matplotlib

Usage
1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/keshav-gupta-07/stock_price_prediction.git
2) pip install -r requirements.txt
3) After training, you can use the trained model for prediction by running: python main.ipynb
