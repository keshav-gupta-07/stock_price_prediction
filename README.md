# stock_price_prediction

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

Usage
1.) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/keshav-gupta-07/stock_price_prediction.git
2.) pip install -r requirements.txt
3.) After training, you can use the trained model for prediction by running: python main.ipynb
